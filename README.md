Used Decision Tree to predict whether a bank note is authentic or fake depending upon the four different attributes of the image of the note
The bill_authentication.csvPreview the document file is taken from UCI Machine Learning repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication (Links to an external site.)).

Used this dataset to predict whether a bank note is authentic or fake depending upon the four different attributes of the image of the note. The attributes are Variance of wavelet transformed image, curtosis of the image, entropy, and skewness of the image.

Used Decision Trees to build a classifier for the give data. Used Grid Search to find the optimal value for the hyperparameters, and evaluated model on suitable metrics. Used graphviz to visualize your decision tree.
